<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

**ad2image** provides an easy-to-use, minimalistic HTTP API to retrieve user photos from an Active Directory / Microsoft Exchange environment. It also provides fallback photos using [avatar-generator](https://gitlab.talanlabs.com/gabriel-allaigre/avatar-generator-parent) if a user has no photo.

Behind the curtains, by default a 64x64 pixel thumbnail photo is retrieved from Active Directory (Attribute `thumbnailPhoto`). Higher resolution photos can also be used, those will be fetched internally by using the [Exchange EWS REST API](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/exchange/client-developer/exchange-web-services/how-to-get-user-photos-by-using-ews-in-exchange#get-a-mailbox-user-photo-by-using-rest).

**ad2image** can be integrated in your Spring Boot application by using the provided starter `ad2image-spring-boot-starter`.
If you want to deploy **ad2image** as a standalone application, you can use the provided container image.

**ad2image** was initially created as **mucatar** internally at it@M. It is used by many of our in-house projects to provide user photos for a richer user experience. For example, it can be very easily used as photo provider for [Vuetify's Avatar component](https://vuetifyjs.com/en/components/avatars/).

### Built With

This project is built with technologies we use in our projects:

- Java
- Spring Boot

<p align="right">(<a href="#top">back to top</a>)</p>

## Set up

```bash
mvn clean install
```

For development, a Active Directory / Exchange environment is not needed. It is mocked by an embedded LDAP server and WireMock (for the EWS API).

## Documentation

### Using the API

`GET /avatar?uid=john.doe[&m=identicon|404|fallbackIdenticon][&size=64]`

Possible modes (`m`):

- `404`: 404 Response, if the user has no photo stored in AD/Exchange
- `identicon`: **default** - renders an [Identicon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identicon), if the user has no photo stored in AD/Exchange
- `fallbackIdenticon`: identical to `identicon`, but also responds with an Identicon if the user itself does not exist in AD/Exchange
- `generic`: renders an [generic placeholder icon](ad2image-spring-boot-starter/src/main/resources/account_64.png), if the user has no photo stored in AD/Exchange
- `fallbackGeneric`: identical to `generic`, but also responds with an generic placeholder icon if the user itself does not exist in AD/Exchange
- `triangle`: renders an [randomly generated Avatar based on triangles](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gabrie-allaigre/avatar-generator/master/doc/triangle1.png), if the user has no photo stored in AD/Exchange
- `fallbackTriangle`: identical to `triangle`, but also responds correspondingly if the user itself does not exist in AD/Exchange
- `square`: renders an [randomly generated Avatar based on squares](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gabrie-allaigre/avatar-generator/master/doc/square1.png), if the user has no photo stored in AD/Exchange
- `fallbackSquare`: identical to `square`, but also responds correspondingly if the user itself does not exist in AD/Exchange
- `github`: renders an [randomly generated Avatar based Github avatar style](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gabrie-allaigre/avatar-generator/master/doc/github2.png), if the user has no photo stored in AD/Exchange
- `fallbackGithub`: identical to `github`, but also responds correspondingly if the user itself does not exist in AD/Exchange

Possible resolutions (`size`):

- `64` (default)
- `96`
- `120`
- `240`
- `360`
- `432`
- `504`
- `648`
